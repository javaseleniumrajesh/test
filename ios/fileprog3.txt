File class Program #3:
==================
class FileParentDirectoryDemo {
public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException{
File f1 = new File("abc.txt");
f1.createNewFile(); //abc.txt is created as normal file in current working 
directory
File f2 = new File("bbc.txt");
f2.mkdir(); //bbc.txt is created as directory in current working directory. 
We can create directories with extensions.
File f3 = new File("xyz");
f3.mkdir(); //xyz is created as directory in current working directory.
File f4 = new File(f3, "1.txt");
f4.createNewFile(); //1.txt is created as normal file in xyz directory.
File f5 = new File(f3, "abc");
f5.mkdir(); //abc is created as directory in xyz directory.
File f6 = new File("pqr", "stv");
f6.mkdirs(); //pqr is created as directory in current working directory, and stv is 
created in pqr as subdirectory.
System.out.println("f1: "+f1);
